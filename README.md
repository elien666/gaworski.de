## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` to see the site.

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google Analytics tracking ID:

```bash
echo "PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX" > .env
```

Or manually create the file with:

```
PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

**Note:** The Google Analytics tracking ID is optional. If not provided, the cookie consent banner will still appear, but analytics will not be loaded.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` folder with static files ready for deployment.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Development Workflow

**Pull Requests Required:** All changes must be submitted via Pull Requests (PRs) to merge into the `main` branch. Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed.

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed when a new release is created. The deployment process:

1. Create a new release with a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Build the site
   - Deploy it to the production server

The `dist/` folder contains static files that can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages
- Any static hosting provider
